Python script to download and set NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day as your wallpaper (Windows)

There are numerous other similiar scripts, most of which probably work better and do more. 
This is mostly just a practice project, attempted with minimal peeking at others' similiar projects.
It includes *very*, very, **very**, minor error handling and error logging capabilities. 

Requires [Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/),
mostly because I ran into it on multiple occasions and never used it....
so I tried it out in what ended up being a very minimal capacity. 

*Only tested on Windows 7.*
